# Basic Poetry Generator
A simple Python script that generates poems based on user input themes like nature, love, and sadness. The program randomly selects words and combines them into unique poems using predefined templates. No external dependencies required, just Python 3. Clone the repo and run the script to generate poetry!
## How It Works:
1. The user inputs a theme (e.g., nature, love).
2. The script selects random words related to the theme.
3. It then generates a poem using a random template filled with those words.
